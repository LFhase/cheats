\fsection{Graph coloring}

\thm{A $d$-degenerate graph can be coloured with $d$+1 colours.}

\prf{Greedy.}

\thm[Brooks]{A graph can be coloured using $\Delta$ colours if it's not an odd cycle or a complete graph.}

\prf{The choosability version of this follows from ERT theorem.}

\thm[Vizing]{A graph is edge-colorable using either $Δ$ or $Δ+1$ colours.}

\prf{Induction on $||G||$. For a coloring of $G - uv$, one colour is missing in $δ(u)$ and one in $δ(v)$. A maximal
graph on those two color classes has a path from $u$ to $v$, otherwise done.

Choose vertices $xy_0$. Find a maximal set of vertices of $δ(x)$ such
that the colour missing at $y_0$ is the colour of the edge $xy_1$, the
colour missing at $y_1$ is present on the edge $xy_2$ etc.

Take last $xy_k$ and its missing colour $β$. Create Kempe chain to some
$y_i$ to $x$. Switch to $y_i$, find Kempe chain again. Contradiction.

}

\thm[Thomassen]{Every planar graph is $5$-choosable.}

\prf{Every face bounded by a triangle, outer face a cycle. Suppose one vertex is coloured $1$, other $2$
and the rest on the outer face have $L(v)=3$ and the inside vertices $L(v)=5$. Then $G$ colourable.

Apply induction, look for chord, remove vertices if outer face chordless.
}

\thm[Erdos-Rabin-Taylor]{Gallai trees.}

\lem[Kernel lemma]{ Let $G$ be a graph with associated lists for colouring. If $G$
has an orientation with $d^{+}(v) < |S_v|$ everywhere, and this orientation also
has a kernel for every induced subgraph, then $H$ can be coloured by $S_v$.
}

\prf{ Induction. Take a colour $α$, find all vertices that have it in their lists,
find their kernel. Colour kernel, remaining vertices still fulfill conditions, induce.
}

\thm[Galvin]{$χ'(G) = χ_L'(G)$ for bipartite graphs.}

\prf{We need to find an orientation for the line graph sasisfying the lemma. Take two partitions. Take $k$-coloring.
Assign orientation based on colouring, and based on where the two
edges meet ($X$ or $Y$). Prove condititons.  }

\opn[Hadwiger]{$k$-colorability implies a minor of $K_k$.}

Proven for $5$, $6$.

\opn[List Coloring Conjecture]{Edge choosability and edge colorability coincide.}

\fsection{Regular graphs}

\thm[Turan]{$∀r>1, n$ every graph without a $K^r$ subgraph and $ex(n,K^r)$ edges is a
Turan graph $T^{r-1}$.}

\prf{Among complete $k$-partite graphs, Turan graphs have the most edges. Among Turan
graphs, $T^{r-1}$ has the most edges. We need to prove that a graph with $ex(n,K^r)$ edges
is a complete multipartite graph.

If not, non-adjacency is not equivalence, and so find three conflicting vertices. Duplicating
some yields the contradiction.
}

\obs{$t_{r-1}(n) ≤ n^2/2 {r-2 \over r-1}$.}

\dfn{Density $d(A,B) = ||(A,B)|| / |A||B|$.}

\dfn{An {\it $ε$-regular pair} $(A,B)$ for given $ε$ has the property that every set $(X,Y)$
of size at least $εX, εY$ respectively has density $d(X,Y)$ $ε$-close to $d(A,B)$.
}

\dfn{An {\it $ε$-regular partition} for given $ε$ satisfies the following:
\itemize\ibull
\: $|V_0| ≤ ε|V|$.
\: $|V_i| = |V_j|$.
\: All but most $εk^2$ pairs are not $ε$-regular.
}

\lem[Regularity lemma]{For every $ε$ and every $m ∃ M$ such that every graph of size $≥ m$
admits an $ε$-regular partition.}

\thm[Erdos-Stone]{For all $r≥2, s≥1, ε>0 ∃ n_0$ such that all graphs with more vertices
and at least $t_{r-1}(n) + ε n^2$ edges contain $K_r^s$ as a subgraph.}

\lem[Removal lemma]{ TBD.}

\fsection{Graph connectivity}

\thm[Menger]{$G$ graph. Then minimum number of vertices separating $A$ from $B$ in $G$
is equal to the maximum number of disjoint $A-B$ paths in $G$.}

\prf{Induction on $||G||$. If $G$ has no $k$ disjoint $A-B$ paths, contract one edge
$e = xy$. $G/e$ contains an $A-B$ separator $Y$ of less than $k$ vertices. One of them
must be the contracted $v_e$. Therefore $Y-v_e+x+y$ must be a separator in $G$ of exactly
$k$ vertices.

Consider now $G-e$. Every $A-X$ separator in $G-e$ is an $A-B$ separator in $G$, and so each such
separator has at least $k$ vertices. Therefore, there are $k$ disjoint $A-X$ paths and $k$
disjoint $B-X$ paths. These paths do not meet outside $X$, and can be extended to $A-B$ paths.
}

\thm[Mader]{

}

\lem{There is a function $h$ such that every graph of average degree $h(r)$ contains
$K^r$ as a topological minor.}

\prf{We show by induction on $m=r … {r \choose 2}$ that every graph with average degree
$≥ 2^m$ has a topological minor $X$ with $r$ vertices and $m$ edges.

Induction start can be done easily with a maximal cycle. Now, consider $d(G) ≥ 2^m$.
Assume $G$ connected. Find maximal set $U$ s.t. $d(G/U) ≥ 2^m$. Vertex with minimum degree
is acceptable, so there exists such a nonempty set, and $δ(U) ≠ ∅$.

Take neighborhood $δ(U)$. If there is any vertex with degree < $2^{m-1}$, we can add it.
Thus, minimum/average degree is $≥ 2^{m-1}$. Apply induction. Take topological minor
and connect two vertices through $U$, which is connected.
}

\thm{$k$-linked implies $f(k)$-connected.}

\prf{Prove it for $f(k) = h(3k) + 2k$. Find topological minor of $K^{3k}$. Use Menger
on its vertices and $2k$ vertices $S$ and $T$. Choose $k$ vertices in $K^{3k}$ that do not
have endvertices on the $2k$ disjoint paths by Menger. Connect the paths.

\thm[Burnside lemma]{

}

\thm[Polya enumeration]{

}

\fsection{Matching theory}

\thm[Hall]{Bipartite graph has PM iff $∀ A⊆X: δ(A) ≥ |A|$. }
\prf{Use Menger or mincut-maxflow on $G$. If there is not a perfect matching,
there exist $A ⊆ X$ and $B ⊆ Y$ such that $|A| + |B| < |X|$ there is no edge from $X ∖ A$ to $Y ∖ B$.
Then $δ(X ∖ A) ⊆ B$ and $|δ(X ∖ A)| ≤ |B| < |X| - |A| = |X ∖ A|$.}

\thm[Tutte]{A graph has a 1-factor iff $∀S: q(G ∖ S) ≤ |S|$, where $q$ counts the number of odd components.}

\prf{Choose $S_0$ maximal such that the inequality becomes an equality.
Prove then that even components have a PM, odd components without a
vertex have a PM and finally using Hall that $S_0$ to $\{C|C$ odd $\}$
has a PM.  }


Edmonds' Algorithm: Find an Edmonds forest, contract flowers (odd cycles).

\fsection{Ramsey theorey}

\dfn{$[X]^k$ is a set of all $k$-tuples of $X$.}

\thm[Infinite Ramsey]{Let $k,c$ be positive numbers, $X$ infinite. If we color $[X]^k$ by $c$ colors,
we find a monochromatic infinite subset.}

\prf{Prove it by induction on $k$, with $c$ fixed. Construct a series of sets $X_i$ and associated elements $x_i$ such that:
\itemize\ibull
\: $X_{i+1} = X_i - x_i.$
\: All $k$-sets $x_i ∪ Z$ with $Z$ from $X_{i+1}$ are monochromatic with colour that we associate with $x_i$.
\endlist

Just pick $x_i$ arbitrarily and note that if you associate the colour of $x_i$ to $k-1$-sets of $X_i - x_i$,
you can apply induction on $k$ and get condition 2.

Since $x_i$ is an infinite set, at least one colour occurs infinitely
many times, and this colour is the monochromatic subset.

}

\thm[Finite Ramsey]{
For every $k,c,r$ there exists $n≥k$ such that all $[n]^k$ colourings with $c$ colours contain a monochromatic
subset of size $r$.
}

\prf{If not, for all $n≥k$ there is a bad colouring. Use Konig's Infinity Lemma (compactness) and extend the bad
colourings into an infinite one. This contradicts infinite Ramsey.}


\thm[Erdos-Szekeres]{For $k≥2, l≥ 2$, every non-degenerate set of ${k+l-4 \choose k-2} +1$ points in the plane
contains a $k$-cup or a $l$-cap. Also for less points, a set avoiding
this exists.}

\prf{Induction. Suppose that there is a set of ${k+l-4 \choose k-2} + 1$ points an it has neither.
Choose $L$ the list of last points of $k-1$-cups. Then $X ∖ L$ has no $k-1$ cup or $l$ cap. Apply induction.
$L$ is therefore big enough and (by induction) contains a $l-1$ cap.
}

\thm[Van-der-Waarden]{Given $k,r$ there exists $n_0$ such that if we colour all sequences of length $≥ n_0$
with $k$ colours, we get a monochromatic arithmetic sequence of length $r$.}
