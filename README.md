## a cheat sheet collection for computer science

This collection of TeX-based cheat sheets was creating during my (ongoing) stay at the Charles University in Prague,
where I study computer science (I am currently a PhD studying approximation and online algorithms).

The goal is to create a compact reference for individual courses (or final exam topics) so that people who have
already studied the subjects can re-learn the essentials quickly. The secondary goal is to help memorization of the
necessary bits of proofs so that a smart reader can generate the entire proof during an exam.

The PDF files are hosted at my university page, and will be linked below.
